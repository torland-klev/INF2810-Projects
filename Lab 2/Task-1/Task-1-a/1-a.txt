After looking at the schematics of the synthesised design, one can conclude that the first
method has more LUT consumpton than the second method. Both methods have 16 inputs going into a LUT, but
the first method uses has inputs going to 4 LUTs while the first method has inputs going to only 3 LUTs. 
Note: it is possible to generate a module level utilization report ("detailed map report"), which shows what modules use the
what resources.

From the schematics in the RTL analysis it is easy to see which method uses the lowest amount of ports; the 
second one. Fewer ports means less delay.

3 a)

The output data change on the third clock cycle. This is because signals change their assigned value
after the process is done running. This means: the first clock cycle, data1 will recieve the input data.
Then on the second clock cycle, data3 will recieve the same input data. Finally, on the third cycle, 
data5 will recieve the input data (thereby chaning the output data).

3 b)

Output changes to input after 450 ns (on the fifth rising edge). The input is UUUUUUUU after 50ns because the output data
has not been initialized. Its first after 100 ns when the reset signal sets the output to 0..0.

3 c)

Output (7 downto 6) and (3 downto 2) is always the same as signals change only after the process is done running.
Therefore they are put to the values that sig1 and sig2 is at the process start. Output (5 downto 4) and (1 downto 0)
are assigned by variables that are given different values before each assignment.

3 d)

As the signals are taken out of the sensitivity list the process no longer cares if they are changed or not
during the process. Previously, when the signals where assigned new values, the process would re-run itself
until no further changes where made in the assignements. This happens after two process-iterations when the
signals are part of the sensitivity list. 
As the signals are taken out of the sensitivity list, the output dependent on the signals will be assigned to
be what the signals where when the process started. At the first iteration, the signals are undefined, therefore
the outputs dependent on the signals will be undefined. On the second iteration, the signals will have been 
change previously, therefore they have new values. The output will be assigned to these values. The signals will
be further changed when the process is done, as the process has assigned them new values.
